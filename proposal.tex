Project proposal. Discuss your proposed idea with course staff over the next
week, before the proposal deadline, to flesh out the exact problem you will be
addressing, how you will go about doing it, and what tools you might need in the
process. By the proposal deadline, you must submit a one-to-two-page proposal
describing: your group members list, the problem you want to address, how you
plan to address it, and what are you proposing to specifically design and
implement.

\paragraph{Problem} ~\\
The Android framework allows apps and components within apps to communicate with one another by broadcasting messages to BroadcastReceivers with messages contained in \href{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html}{Intents}. While the security vulnerabilities in outgoing Intents has been well studied\cite{chin_analayzing_2011} and developer tools exist to limit potentially insecure Intents, little has been done to address malicious incoming Intents. Exploits of this nature have been discovered in firmware of various Android phones\cite{grace_systematic_2012}, but third-party applications have not been explored. Application developers must make sure their manifest file has been properly configured to only accept desired Intents, which can limit usability. We believe that developers will trust Intent input by default, allowing malicious input to potentially crash or abuse the application. 

\paragraph{Proposal} ~\\
We plan to build a static analysis tool that will look for vulnerabilities in
Android apps that result from bad intent processing. This analysis tool will
look at BroadcastReceivers that are not protected by system or signature
privileges and trace the input from those intents. If the input is used to
access sensitive data or priviliges without being sanitized, it will be marked
as a potential vulnerability. We will test our tool on apps found on the
\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps}{Google Play} store and use a dissasembly tool such as Dedexer or bacsmali to evaluate the application code. If we find an app
with a bug that will allow us to do something interesting, we will also create
an app that demonstrates the potential exploits.
