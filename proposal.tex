\begin{comment}
Project proposal. Discuss your proposed idea with course staff over the next
week, before the proposal deadline, to flesh out the exact problem you will be
addressing, how you will go about doing it, and what tools you might need in the
process. By the proposal deadline, you must submit a one-to-two-page proposal
describing: your group members list, the problem you want to address, how you
plan to address it, and what are you proposing to specifically design and
implement.
