Project proposal. Discuss your proposed idea with course staff over the next
week, before the proposal deadline, to flesh out the exact problem you will be
addressing, how you will go about doing it, and what tools you might need in the
process. By the proposal deadline, you must submit a one-to-two-page proposal
describing: your group members list, the problem you want to address, how you
plan to address it, and what are you proposing to specifically design and
implement.

\paragraph{Problem} ~\\
The Android framework allows apps and components within apps to communicate with one another by broadcasting messages to BroadcastReceivers with messages contained in \href{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html}{Intents}. While the security vulnerabilities in outgoing Intents has been well studied\cite{chin_analayzing_2011} and developer tools exist to limit potentially insecure Intents, little has been done to address malicious incoming Intents. Exploits of this nature have been discovered in firmware of various Android phones\cite{grace_systematic_2012}, but third-party applications have not been explored. Application developers must make sure their manifest file has been properly configured to only accept desired Intents, which can limit usability. We believe that developers will trust Intent input by default, allowing malicious input to potentially crash or abuse the application. 

\paragraph{Proposal} ~\\
We plan to build a static analysis tool that will look for vulnerabilities in Android apps that result from bad Intent processing. This analysis tool will look at application use of the three Intent resolution classes, Activity, BroadcastReceiver, and Service, that are not protected by system or signature privileges. Intent input that is directly used by these classes without checking or sanitization will be considered a potential vulnerability. We will test our tool on apps found on the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps}{Google Play} store and use a dissasembly tool such as Dedexer\cite{dedexer} or baksmali\cite{baksmali} to evaluate the application code. We will look for potential vulnerabilities using the proposed static analysis tool and further examine applications that use uncheck Intent input to access sensitive data or priveleges. If we find an app with a bug that will allow us to do something interesting, we will also create an app that demonstrates the potential exploits.
