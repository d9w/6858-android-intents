\paragraph{Problem} ~\\ The Android framework allows apps and components within
apps to communicate with one another by passing messages, called
\href{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html}{Intents},
which specify both a procedure to call and the arguments to use. Applications
must declare in a static manifest file which intents each component services, as
well as both application and component level permissions. While the security
vulnerabilities in outgoing Intents has been well studied
\cite{chin_analyzing_2011} and developer tools exist to limit potentially
insecure Intents, little has been done to address malicious incoming Intents.
Exploits of this nature have been discovered in firmware of various Android
phones \cite{grace_systematic_2012}, but exploits in third-party applications
are not well studied. Application developers must make sure their manifest file
has been properly configured to only accept desired Intents, which can limit
usability. We believe that developers will trust Intent input by default,
allowing malicious input to potentially crash or abuse the application.

\paragraph{Static analysis} ~\\

To start, we implemented a basic static analysis tool to aid us in identifying
potential vulnerabilities in Android applications. Our tool operates on raw Android
application package files. First, we extract the manifest file and compile a
list of public components. Define public components. Then we decompile the
Dalvik bytecodes of the application and search for method calls which require
the app to hold Android permissions. Finally, we construct a control flow graph
of the application and search for paths connecting our open compnents (entry
points) to our privileged method calls (exit points), and report all paths we
find as potential vulnerabilities. These paths represent possible
vulnerabilities because they allow an unprivileged application to cause
execution of privileged methods via an intent.

Following the methodology outlined in Section 4.3 of \cite{chin_analyzing_2011}
for analyzing android application components, we implemented a static
analysis tool for detecting
