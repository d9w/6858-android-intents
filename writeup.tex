\paragraph{Problem} ~\\ The Android framework allows apps and components within
apps to communicate with one another by passing messages, called
\href{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html}{Intents},
which specify both a procedure to call and the arguments to use. Applications
must declare in a static manifest file which intents each component services, as
well as both application and component level permissions. While the security
vulnerabilities in outgoing Intents has been well studied
\cite{chin_analyzing_2011} and developer tools exist to limit potentially
insecure Intents, little has been done to address malicious incoming Intents.
Exploits of this nature have been discovered in firmware of various Android
phones \cite{grace_systematic_2012}, but exploits in third-party applications
are not well studied. Application developers must make sure their manifest file
has been properly configured to only accept desired Intents, which can limit
usability. We believe that developers will trust Intent input by default,
allowing malicious input to potentially crash or abuse the application.

\paragraph{Static analysis} ~\\

\paragraph{Common app vulnerabilites} -\\

The most common vulnerability was apps that would load an arbitrary URL on receiving an intent. Although the attacker cannot receive data from the internet, they can submit forms containing any data that the app had access to, or visit attacker controlled websites. The ability to force the user to visit an attacker controlled URL means that attackers can learn the IP address of any user, which is one of the factors used to determine the coarse location, which is supposed to be protected.  \\
Interestingly, the stock Android browser will also load any URL that it receives in an intent. This means that you can force a user to visit any webpage with any cookies that they have saved. 

\paragraph{Exploit} -\\
We built an exploit to send an Intent to the browser with a URL pointing to a site we control. 

\paragraph{Conclusion} -\\
